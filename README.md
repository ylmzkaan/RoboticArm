As a graduation project, we have designed and manufactured a 4-DOF robotic arm. 
We used 4 Pololu DC motors with built-in incremental encoders. 
All DC motors are driven by two Pololu Dual VNH5019 Dc Motor drivers. 
We used Arduino Mega as the microcontroller. 
This repository contains the main code that gives a user-defined ramp signal to motors of the robotic arm.
